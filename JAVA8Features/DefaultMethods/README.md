Here's a detailed comparison of default methods in Java with lambda expressions, method references, regular methods, static methods, and functional interfaces, along with explanations and examples.

### Default Methods

**Definition**: Default methods are methods defined in interfaces with a default implementation. They were introduced in Java 8 to allow interfaces to evolve without breaking existing implementations.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Can have a body (implementation).
- Can be overridden in implementing classes.
- Provide a way to add new methods to interfaces without affecting existing classes that implement those interfaces.

**Example**:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    void regularMethod(); // Abstract method

    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    @Override
    public void regularMethod() {
        System.out.println("Implementing the regular method.");
    }
}

public class DefaultMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        myClass.regularMethod(); // Output: Implementing the regular method.
        myClass.defaultMethod(); // Output: This is a default method.
    }
}
```

| **Access**               | Can be accessed via instances           | Not applicable                      | Not applicable                      | Accessed via instances or static calls | Accessed via class name             | Not applicable                      |

### Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Default Methods**
- **Purpose**: Allow interfaces to evolve by adding new methods with default implementations.
- **Example**: As shown above, you can define default methods in an interface and implement them in classes that implement the interface.

#### 2. **Lambda Expressions**
- **Purpose**: Provide a concise way to express instances of single abstract method (functional) interfaces.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  MyInterface myLambda = () -> System.out.println("Lambda implementation.");
  myLambda.regularMethod(); // Output: Lambda implementation.
  ```
- **Comparison**: Lambdas provide a way to implement functional interfaces without the boilerplate of a full class.

#### 3. **Method References**
- **Purpose**: Provide a shorthand to refer to methods without executing them.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  MyInterface myReference = new MyClass()::defaultMethod;
  myReference.defaultMethod(); // Output: This is a default method.
  ```
- **Comparison**: Method references are a concise way to refer to existing methods, making the code cleaner and more readable.

#### 4. **Regular Methods**
- **Purpose**: Define standard methods within a class.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  class AnotherClass {
      void regularMethod() {
          System.out.println("Regular method implementation.");
      }
  }
  ```
- **Comparison**: Regular methods are specific to classes and do not have the flexibility of default methods in interfaces.

#### 5. **Static Methods**
- **Purpose**: Define methods that belong to the class rather than instances of the class.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  class Utility {
      static void staticMethod() {
          System.out.println("Static method implementation.");
      }
  }
  ```
- **Comparison**: Static methods cannot be overridden and are called on the class itself, unlike instance methods.

#### 6. **Functional Interfaces**
- **Purpose**: Interfaces that contain exactly one abstract method, allowing them to be used as the target for lambda expressions and method references.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @FunctionalInterface
  interface MyFunctionalInterface {
      void execute();
  }
  ```
- **Comparison**: Functional interfaces are fundamental to the lambda expressions and method references introduced in Java 8, promoting functional programming.

### Conclusion

- **Default methods** in interfaces enhance their usability and allow for backward compatibility while evolving APIs.
- **Lambda expressions** and **method references** provide concise syntax for implementing functional interfaces.
- **Regular methods** and **static methods** serve their distinct purposes in class design.
- **Functional interfaces** serve as the foundation for functional programming in Java.

Understanding these concepts and their relationships allows developers to write more flexible, concise, and maintainable code in Java.
