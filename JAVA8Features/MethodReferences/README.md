### Example Scenario
We'll create a simple class with a method to compare two strings and sort a list of names.

### Class Definition
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List;

public class MethodReferenceExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Charlie", "Alice", "Bob");

        // 1. Using a regular method
        Collections.sort(names, new MethodReferenceExample()::compareStrings);
        System.out.println("Sorted using regular method: " + names);

        // Resetting the list for the next example
        names = Arrays.asList("Charlie", "Alice", "Bob");

        // 2. Using a lambda expression
        Collections.sort(names, (s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2));
        System.out.println("Sorted using lambda: " + names);

        // Resetting the list for the next example
        names = Arrays.asList("Charlie", "Alice", "Bob");

        // 3. Using a method reference
        Collections.sort(names, String::compareTo);
        System.out.println("Sorted using method reference: " + names);
    }

    // Regular method to compare two strings
    public int compareStrings(String s1, String s2) {
        return s1.compareTo(s2);
    }
}
```

### Output
```
Sorted using regular method: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
Sorted using lambda: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
Sorted using method reference: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
```

### Comparative Analysis

| Aspect                       | Regular Method                        | Lambda Expression                      | Method Reference                     |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**                   | More verbose, requires method name   | More concise, inline implementation    | Very concise, direct reference       |
| **Readability**              | Clear for complex logic, but verbose | Readable for simple cases              | Highly readable if method name is clear |
| **Flexibility**              | Can handle complex logic easily      | Flexible for custom logic              | Limited to the referenced methodâ€™s functionality |
| **Debugging**                | Easier to debug due to method name   | Debugging requires understanding inline logic | Can be less clear, especially with overloaded methods |
| **Performance**              | Slight overhead of method call       | Similar to method call, inline context | Slightly more overhead due to indirection |
| **Use Case Limitations**     | Can be used anywhere                  | Limited to functional interfaces        | Limited to functional interfaces      |

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Regular Method
- **Advantages**:
  - Clear and explicit, especially for complex logic.
  - Easier to debug with clear stack traces.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More verbose and requires more boilerplate code.
  - Less flexible for simple operations.

#### Lambda Expression
- **Advantages**:
  - Concise and expressive, ideal for simple logic.
  - Allows for inline definitions, making code cleaner.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can become less readable if complex.
  - Harder to debug due to lack of named context.

#### Method Reference
- **Advantages**:
  - Very concise and improves readability.
  - Directly ties to existing methods, reducing boilerplate.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited to the behavior of the method being referenced.
  - Can lead to ambiguity with overloaded methods.

### Conclusion
Choosing between a regular method, lambda expression, and method reference depends on the context and complexity of the task. Regular methods are suitable for complex logic, lambda expressions are great for simplicity, and method references enhance readability when tied to well-defined methods. Each approach has its pros and cons, and understanding these can help you write better, more maintainable code.
